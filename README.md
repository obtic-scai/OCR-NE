# OCR-NER

This repository contains code developed for the spell checking of the raw OCRised French texts in the TEI-XML format issued from the [Très Grande Bibliothèque](http://obvil.lip6.fr/tgb/) (TGB).

Three spellchecking libraries have been tested: [`pyspellchecker`](https://github.com/barrust/pyspellchecker), [`pyenchant`](https://github.com/pyenchant/pyenchant) and [`jamspell`](https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell), with the aim to evaluate their general performance.
